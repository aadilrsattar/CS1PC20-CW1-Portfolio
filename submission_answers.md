#Question 1
It is important to write code libraries incase you need to call a certain function very often so
instead of rewriting code unnecessarily, in the long run, libraries will save time.
In smaller projects it may not be as essential, as it may infact impact the time taken to 
complete the project

#Question 2
Include directives allow for you to call code from another file in to your code, and allow you to
use the function of that code. It can save time if you're gonna use the same lines of codes but 
in different files. These files often end with .h and are referred to as headers or interfaces.
An interface is a header file that has a different file extension than the implementation file,
e.g using the .h file with a .c
